## Project Overview

### Project name

Curve Safe App

### Team members 

Tom French (`Tom French#3331` on Discord)

I'm not related to the Curve team.

### What project are you building 

I'm planning on a simple integration of [Curve Finance](https://curve.fi) to allow Safe users to quickly trade between flavours of stablecoins.

I'm not planning on adding the option to provide liquidity to the pool in this release. I'm also not planning on supporting the BTC pair as of yet.

Use cases:
1. Optimising yield from stablecoin lending in other Safe Apps.
2. Everyday conversion of tokens used for payments

### Why did you decide to build it 

I'm expecting that many of the early Safe apps are going heavily involve stablecoins and their use in lending protocols.
Currently if a Safe user wants to convert to a different stablecoin to increase their yield, they are required to give custody to a single key holder who performs the swap and then returns funds to the Safe.

Using this app, they would be able to chase yield while remaining safely within the Safe ecosystem.

### How long will it take 

I don't imagine this would take too long, a couple of days maybe. This would be my [second app](https://github.com/TomAFrench/sablier-safe-app/) so I can hit the ground running.

### How much funding are you requesting  

\$750 since it's a relatively simple project.
